# About Sudan Blueprint

**Sudan Blueprint** is an independent, public knowledge resource built to support inclusive, transparent, and data-driven development in Sudan.

We document real-world solutions, lessons learned, and replicable strategies from across Sudan’s diverse regions and sectors. Our goal is to empower practitioners, planners and researchers with trusted, grounded insights.

### Why this project?

-   Sudan faces enormous development challenges — but also a wealth of local innovation and practical experience.
-   Much of this knowledge is undocumented or inaccessible.
-   We aim to fill that gap — collaboratively.

This initiative is maintained by a community of researchers, developers, and contributors. It is open-source and non-commercial.
